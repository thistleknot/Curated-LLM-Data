"# Curated-LLM-Data" 

As my token of appreciation to humanity, and to show that AI can be a net positive gain in everyone's lives, I had the idea to start a community forum to track ideas for inclusion towards a free knowledge graph document store with the aim of being updated, access to all with minimal setup, and hopefully one day links to models pretrained on the dataset and/or using the dataset as a knowledge graph (elastic search) documentStore to perform dense passage retrieval on.
